# Versus

Versus takes a stream of requests and runs them against multiple endpoints
simultaneously, comparing the output and timing.


## Goals

Features:

- Run against a single endpoint or many.
- Run against local or remote endpoints.
- Real-time parallel test execution.
- Compare results across separately-run tests
- Use live-streaming tcpdump data as test payloads

Compare between endpoints:

- Response integrity: Body, status
- Latency
- Throughput
